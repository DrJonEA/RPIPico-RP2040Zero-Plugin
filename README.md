# RPIPico-RP2040Zero-Plugin
Use a RPI Pico in a RP2040Zero Socket for development purposes.

I love the small footprint of the RP2040Zero for some projects. Working with it in development though is a pain as the SWD ports are not exposed. To get around this I build an adapter board so I could use a Raspberry Pi Pico as a plugin for the RP2040 Zero during development.

Included in this repo is the kikad  files and an example project.

The adapter also has a reset switch on it and three LED. One is permanently on. The other two are connected to GP20 and GP21 via jumpers. So you can choose to conect these or not into the circuit.
